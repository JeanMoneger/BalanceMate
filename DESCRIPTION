Description: This package groups functions that facilitates postural data management (e.g., merging data files, time-stamping the files, creating epochs), pre-processing (e.g., applying filter), and processing (e.g., computing Center of Pressure, Sway Path Length). It is designed to work with .txt outputs exported from the AMTI software "NetForce". *This work was supported by the laboratory Vision Action Cognition (Université Paris Cité), which provided the resources and environment necessary for this project's development.
